# One-Click Apps for Akamai Connected Cloud

This repository contains the deployment scripts and Ansible playbooks for two Akamai Connected Cloud Marketplace apps that I developed and published: **JupyterLab** and **InfluxDB**. These apps have been submitted as pull requests to the official Akamai Compute Marketplace project, have been merged, and are now fully deployable on Akamai Connected Cloud.

## Akamai Connected Cloud Marketplace Apps

### 1. JupyterLab
- **Description**: JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.
- **Deployment**: The Ansible playbook for JupyterLab is located in the `linode-marketplace-jupyterlab` folder. The deployment shell script can be found as `jupyterlab-deploy.sh`.
- **PR Link**: [JupyterLab Pull Request #81](https://github.com/akamai-compute-marketplace/marketplace-apps/pull/81)

### 2. InfluxDB
- **Description**: InfluxDB is an open-source time series database designed to handle high write and query loads.
- **Deployment**: The Ansible playbook for InfluxDB is located in the `linode-marketplace-influxdb` folder. The deployment shell script can be found as `influxdb-deploy.sh`.
- **PR Link**: [InfluxDB Pull Request #120](https://github.com/akamai-compute-marketplace/marketplace-apps/pull/120)
